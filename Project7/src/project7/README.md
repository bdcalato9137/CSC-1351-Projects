We had to create sorting algorithms: bubble sort, bubble sort short circuit, 
selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, shell sort, and java sort. It then timed the different sorting 
algorithms on the same array sorting. The table comparing all of the sorting speeds is on the pdf in the
folder.
